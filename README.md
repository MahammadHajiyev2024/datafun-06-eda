# The Project 6 - I will create my own custom exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using GitHub, Git, Jupyter, pandas, Seaborn and other popular data analytics tools.

## Repository Creation 

## Cloned the project down

```
cd myfolder

git clone url address
```

## Created venv and .gitignore

```
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate

```
## Installed dependencies

```
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Document Your Data Set

I will use tips.csv dataset and the link can be found here: https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/tips.csv

## Starting EDA and notebook
Using ipynb, I created a notebook that helped me analyze the dataset mentioned above. I made few analysis on how tips are distributed among different affecting factors.
